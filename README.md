# Participes

> In development.

## Start developing

Clone the Repo. Open a terminal in the root of the project:

```
$ composer install
```

With the `$ composer install` a `.env` file should've been created. 

> From [Laravel Docs](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/installation): If you installed Laravel via Composer or the Laravel installer, this key has already been set for you by the `php artisan key:generate command`.(...) If the application key is not set, your user sessions and other encrypted data will not be secure!

So Look and configure the following env variables (others vars, dont worry) 

```

APP_NAME=Participes
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY= # Run php artisan key:generate and use the output!
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=participes
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=null
MAIL_PASSWORD=null
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=null
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"

QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync
```

Now create a new MySQL database. You can create a `participes` mysql database, if you want to use another name, change it in `DB_DATABASE`. It should be `'charset' => 'utf8mb4' // 'collation' => 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci'`

Now run the first migration. Its the init DB.

```
php artisan migration
php artisan db:seed
```

Your tables should've been created!

## Little Consideration

#### config/app.php

By default the timezone is defined like this. Change it if you need to.

```
'timezone' => 'America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires',
```

#### Available roles

**Role: user**

By default, any new registered user gets the `user` role

**Role: admin**

Those who want to manage the platform should have the `admin` role, which gives them access to a few views and other things.
These should be managed manually. An admin should be able to add other admins.

Just to clarify: We follow this philosophy:
**Admins are not human entities: They are one, and many at the same time. They share the same decisions. They work together. They have concensum. They dont make mistakes.**

With this in mind, we give answers to a few questions:

- *Can an admin delete other admins?* Yes.
- *Can an admin delete content other admins created?* Yes.

They are amazing, right?


## Using REDIS as queue manager

Imagine sending 50 new report emails to subscriptors in one process... it will take like a minute or more for the process to contact the SMTP and it will block the user experience, stuck in the same page, for a minute or more. If we dont want this on production, we need to set up Queues and Workers.

> **NOTE**: If you still want to be blocked by this jobs, you can just use the `sync` option in the `QUEUE_CONNECTION` in the `.env` file like this: `QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync`

In production, we will need to use a complementary service called Redis for queueing jobs. This will accelerate async jobs like mailing and other stuff.

> Why use Redis for your Laravel queue connection? Redis offers clustering and rate limiting. Letâ€™s look at an example of rate limiting and why that might be important. - [https://voltagead.com/the-basics-of-laravel-queues-using-redis-and-horizon/](https://voltagead.com/the-basics-of-laravel-queues-using-redis-and-horizon/)

For development, we need to have REDIS installed. So you should have redis installed locally or just use a docker container.

```
$ docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
```

Useful docker redis commands:
```
$ docker start redis

$ docker stop redis
```

Now in .env, use this env variables:
```
# QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync -- we dont need this
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
SESSION_DRIVER=file
SESSION_LIFETIME=120

REDIS_CLIENT=predis
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PASSWORD=null
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_QUEUE=mailer,default
```

Now in another terminal, run the following in the root directory:

```
$ php artisan queue:work redis --queue:mailer,default
```

Here, one process will work both queues at the same time.
If you prefer to have two different processes for each job queue, you can open two terminal and do: 

```
// Terminal 1
$ php artisan queue:work redis --queue:mailer
```
```
// Terminal 2
$ php artisan queue:work redis --queue:default
```

## Files - Storage Link

Run the following
```
php artisan storage:link
```
