| Maintenance Mode
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| If the application is in maintenance mode, we will automatically send
| the response back to the user so they can see the maintenance message
| instead of having to deal with the errors. This check just makes
| that simple and works without having to modify the front controller.
|
| This comes from updating to Laravel 8
| https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/upgrade#maintenance-mode
| The maintenance mode feature of Laravel has been improved in Laravel 8.x.
| Pre-rendering the maintenance mode template is now supported and eliminates
| the chances of end users encountering errors during maintenance mode. However,
| to support this, the following lines must be added to your public/index.php file.
| These lines should be placed directly under the existing LARAVEL_START constant

| Register The Auto Loader
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Composer provides a convenient, automatically generated class loader for

| into the script here so that we don't have to worry about manual
| loading any of our classes later on. It feels great to relax.
